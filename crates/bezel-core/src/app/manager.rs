//! The storage manager's use cases (D-2026-09-30-storage-manager-2..-11):
//! what a screen stores next to the catalog of what Bezel sent it, uploads,
//! deletes and boot media recorded in that catalog, moving, copying,
//! renaming and restoring files by re-sending their local copies, the
//! cleanup assistant, associating a screen file with its original on the PC,
//! and the local copies' cache.
//!
//! A [`Manager`] works on one screen ([`ScreenLink`]) and the store of local
//! copies ([`ArchiveStore`]). The catalog is loaded from the store and saved
//! back at every step, so the CLI and the studio can share it. Nothing here
//! changes the screen without `Confirm::Yes`: with `Confirm::No` the screen
//! only answers queries. Every file of a batch runs alone, in the only order
//! that cannot lose it (D-2026-09-30-storage-manager-7): preflight on the
//! target, upload of the local copy, check of the stored size, and only then
//! delete of the source. A batch stops at the first failure or cancel.
//! Restoring never deletes and checks the space and the per-file limit
//! before the first byte (D-2026-09-30-storage-manager-8).
