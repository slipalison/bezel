//! What a screen does when the computer shuts down
//! (D-2026-10-03-power-off-standby-2, -3): showing the choice, changing it
//! (which writes the plan B on the screen and records the choice in the
//! catalog shared by the CLI and the studio) and applying it at shutdown.
//!
//! Rev C screens only; any other family is `Unsupported` before anything is
//! sent. Changing the choice needs the screen and `Confirm::Yes`: with
//! `Confirm::No` nothing is sent, loaded or saved. Applying it reads the
//! choice from the catalog itself ([`at_shutdown`] takes no choice from its
//! caller) and sends only what it says (TURNOFF, PLAY_VIDEO in a loop, or
//! OPTIONS and RESTART), and TURNOFF instead when the choice cannot be
//! honoured, so that the screen never stays frozen on the last frame.
