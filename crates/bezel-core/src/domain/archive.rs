//! The catalog of what Bezel sent to each screen, and the local copies of
//! those files (D-2026-09-30-storage-manager-2, -5, -6, -7, -8, -10, -11).
//!
//! The screens list, report sizes, store, delete and play files; they cannot
//! send one back, rename or move it. So Bezel keeps the exact bytes of every
//! upload, addressed by content ([`ContentId`]: the same bytes are kept
//! once), and an [`ArchiveEntry`] per file it sent, keyed by screen
//! ([`ScreenKey`]), medium, folder and name. A card entry also keeps the
//! card's capacity, the only card trait the protocol shows, so a card of
//! another capacity shows the other card's entries as restorable
//! ([`Overview::other_card`]). A screen's record also keeps the boot media
//! Bezel set and what the screen does when the computer shuts down
//! ([`ScreenRecord::standby`]).
//!
//! Moving, renaming and restoring are re-uploads of a copy. This module plans
//! them ([`plan_move`], [`plan_copy`], [`plan_rename`], [`plan_restore`]); the
//! use cases run each [`Step`] alone: send the copy, check the stored size,
//! and only then delete the source. Everything here is pure: the time, the
//! listings and the bytes come from the callers and the `ArchiveStore` port.
