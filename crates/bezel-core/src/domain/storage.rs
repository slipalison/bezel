//!
//! A screen stores media in four folders: internal or card × image or video
//! ([`StorageLocation`]). Their device paths are family knowledge and live in
//! the device adapters (rev C large screens: `/mnt/UDISK/img/`, ...); the core

//! changing the boot media need [`Confirm::Yes`]; the preflight never frees
//! space on its own.
