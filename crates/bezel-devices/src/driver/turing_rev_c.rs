//! Driver for Turing rev C screens (2.1"/2.8"/5"/8.8" UART generation):
//! frames, and the stored files and device-side playback of spec § 13.
//!
//! Nothing storage-related is sent implicitly (spec § 16): the storage
//! commands, OPTIONS 0x7D and playback go out only from the
//! [`ScreenStorage`] methods, which the core's use cases call. 0x81 and 0x82
//! are never sent. RESTART 0x84 goes out only from
//! [`ScreenStorage::restart`], whose [`Confirmed`] proof only an explicit
//! user choice gives (D-2026-09-30-device-protocols-2): the `album` choice
//! applied when the computer shuts down (D-2026-10-03-power-off-standby-3).
//! On small screens the vendor sends 0x82 and re-initialises before
//! PLAY_VIDEO; Bezel does not (disruptive, and no small screen has been
//! validated).
//!
//! What a screen does when the computer shuts down goes out within the
//! shutdown's deadline and waits for nothing afterwards
//! (D-2026-10-03-power-off-standby-3): [`ScreenLink::turn_off_now`] is
//! TURNOFF 0x83 alone, [`ScreenStorage::restart`] RESTART 0x84 alone, and a
//! play stops what plays with one STOP_MEDIA (not the 20 polls of a theme
//! start) before PLAY_VIDEO; nothing follows any of them, 0x87 included.
//!
//! A live link whose frame stops changing still sends frame traffic: when
//! nothing went out for [`KEEPALIVE_AFTER`], an unchanged frame becomes the
//! smallest partial update, pixel 0 as it is, then QUERY_STATUS
//! (D-2026-10-03-power-off-standby-5), so that the screen's own sleep timer
//! (OPTIONS byte 14) never puts a live screen to sleep.
//!
//! A cancelled upload has no abort in the protocol: after the UPLOAD_FILE
//! header the firmware takes every byte as file data until it has the
//! declared length (spec § 19). Bezel sends nothing more of that length
//! after a cancel: completing it with filler hung the 8.8" until a USB
//! replug (D-2026-09-30-release-polish-10). The recovery is HELLO (with its
//! resync blocks), then GET_FILE_SIZE measures the partial file the user is
//! offered to delete. Bytes the firmware's writer still queued may land in
//! the next upload, whose size check (the core's) catches them.
