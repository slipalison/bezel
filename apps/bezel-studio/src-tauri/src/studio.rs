//! The editing session behind the window: the core's [`ThemeRuntime`] with
//! the theme being edited, its assets, the latest readings and the graph
//! histories, and the screen showing it live. It is the same runtime as
//! `bezel run` (D-2026-09-30-studio-app-4): every refresh samples through
//! it, the live screen gets what it renders, and every committed edit swaps
//! the theme in place with the histories kept. Everything goes through the
//! core's ports, so the whole session runs on fakes in tests.
//!
//! A theme with a video background (D-2026-09-30-storage-video-4): the live
//! screen gets what the runtime's [`ThemeRuntime::start_video`] chose: the
//! stored video looping under overlays, the video decoded on this computer
//! for screens that cannot play videos (a copy of the asset is decoded by the
//! media converter the storage tab shares), or the poster
//! ([`VideoState::VideoMissing`] carries what sending it takes).
//!
//! The video is framed (D-2026-10-01-video-background-framing-2 to -5): a
//! copy of it is probed once (an MP4's header needs no ffmpeg) and what it
//! said goes to the runtime, which decides Auto, the copy a screen looks for
//! and how each decoded picture is framed. The preview plays the video when
//! motion is allowed ([`Motion`]): one decoder per session reads the raw
//! source at most [`PREVIEW_FPS`] pictures a second, the runtime frames each
//! picture as the theme says now (a framing edit never restarts it, another
//! video does), and it ends when no picture is asked for during
//! [`PREVIEW_IDLE`], to resume from the clock at the next one. A decoder that
//! fails is tried again after [`PREVIEW_RETRY`], by itself up to
//! [`PREVIEW_ATTEMPTS`] in a row. Without ffmpeg, with motion reduced or a
//! hidden window, the preview shows the poster. The poster is taken again on
//! save when the theme frames its video otherwise than the poster shows.
//!
//! Probing the video and taking a poster run external programs (ffprobe for
//! a container that is not MP4 or GIF, ffmpeg for a poster): the session
//! hands them out ([`VideoProbe`], [`PosterRetake`]) so the caller runs them
//! outside its lock, and takes their outcome back only for the video, poster
//! and framing they were for. Until the video is probed the preview shows
//! the poster and the live screen does not start it.
//!
//! The sensors measure what is shown (D-2026-09-30-release-polish-11): the
//! theme, which the preview always shows, and the sensors the library's
//! list shows ([`Studio::show_sensors`]); `net.ping` sends packets only
//! while one of them uses it.
//!
//! The screen's I/O happens outside the session: a frame is rendered in the
//! session, then the live link leaves it with the frame ([`Delivery`]) and
//! comes back once the screen showed it ([`Studio::presented`]). Previews
//! render meanwhile; whoever needs the link waits for it
//! ([`Studio::presenting`]).
//!
//! Frames come when the runtime says they are due (T-7.11): every refresh,
//! and at a visible animated GIF's frame times; the preview reports when its
//! GIFs change next so the UI can draw them too ([`Studio::preview`]). A
//! live link that fails (the screen stopped reading, a cable glitch) is
//! dropped and the screen connected again after 2, 5 and 10 s, outside the
//! session ([`Studio::reconnect_due`], [`Studio::reconnected`]); turning
//! live mode off meanwhile ends it at once.
//!
//! When the computer shuts down (D-2026-10-03-power-off-standby-3) the
//! session enters a final state ([`Studio::enter_final_state`]) where no
//! frame is drawn, no link is lent or connected again and no screen goes
//! live; the shutdown takes the live link to apply the screen's choice
//! through it ([`Studio::take_for_shutdown`]).
