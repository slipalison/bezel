//! "When the computer shuts down", in the screen's settings
//! (D-2026-10-03-power-off-standby-2, -4, -6): each rev C screen's choice and
//! the plan B written with it, over the core's `app::standby` use cases, and
//! the card's album (`sd/image`), whose photos are framed for the screen as
//! it stands.
//!
//! Screen access is the storage tab's ([`crate::storage`]): one operation at
//! a time under the claim on the screens, the live screen through its open
//! link (lent by the session), any other awake screen opened for the
//! operation and closed after. A screen asleep is never woken: its options
//! say `notConnected` and a change to it is `unsupported`; nor is a screen
//! of another family opened. In the final state of a shutdown every call
//! that reaches a screen answers `busy` (D-2026-10-03-power-off-standby-3).
//!
//! The choice lives in the catalog the CLI shares (`ScreenRecord.standby`,
//! keyed by the screen's model, [`ScreenKey::new`], as the shutdown reads it
//! in [`crate::power`]), read again at every call: a choice the CLI made
//! while the studio runs shows. Changing it, and adding a photo (replacing
//! one of the same name included), takes the user's [`Confirm`], the answer
//! of the UI's dialog that says what is written; with `Confirm::No` nothing
//! reaches any screen and nothing is recorded. Listing and removing the
//! album's photos are the storage tab's `storage_overview` and
//! `delete_stored` (a confirmed delete).
//!
//! A photo is decoded on this computer (`bezel_media::photo`: JPEG, PNG, BMP
//! or a GIF's first picture, its EXIF orientation applied), framed by Fill
//! or Fit into the shape the screen has as it stands (the orientation last
//! used with it, `screenOrientations`, else its model's), turned to the
//! panel and sent as a PNG of the panel's size through the core's
//! `Manager::upload`, which keeps the local copy and records it.
