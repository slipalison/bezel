//! What the studio says outside its window, in the log and on the terminal
//! (D-2026-10-01-gif-sticker-search-12): the one module of its production
//! code that prints or logs.
//!
//! Everything it says is fixed text: a [`DiagCode`], a closed list of codes
//! without data. [`report`] takes nothing else, so no value of the app's (the
//! KLIPY key, an invocation's body, a path, an error's text) reaches a log
//! line or the terminal through it; a value does not compile:
//!
//! ```compile_fail,E0308
//! let body = String::from(r#"{"key":"what the window sent"}"#);
//! bezel_studio::diag::report(body);
//! ```
//!
//! A panic says no more ([`hook_panics`], D-2026-10-01-gif-sticker-search-14):
//! from the first line of `main` on, the terminal gets [`DiagCode::Panicked`]
//! and the place in the source code where the panic happened, never its
//! message, whoever panicked (the app, Tauri, a library).
//!
//! The source guard (`tests::nothing_in_the_app_forges_an_invocation` in
//! `lib.rs`) refuses, anywhere else in the studio's production code, the
//! print and log macros, a panic or an assertion that formats a message, and
//! the output streams, and what an invocation is made of; here, it checks
//! that every function takes only a `DiagCode` or a `&'static str` (none
//! needs one) and is not generic, that the codes carry no data, and that
//! this module uses nothing but `tracing` and its own items (no import, no
//! other module's state, no `static`, no macro of its own), but the one
//! panic hook (`std::panic::set_hook` and its `Box::new` in
//! [`hook_panics`]). Anywhere, it refuses another panic hook, and what
//! installs a logger or a tracing subscriber.
