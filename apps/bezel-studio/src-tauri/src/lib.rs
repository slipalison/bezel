//! Bezel Studio — the desktop driving adapter of Bezel.
//!
//! The webview UI turns clicks into calls on the [`backend`]; every rule
//! about screens, sensors and themes lives in the core and its adapters.
//! [`run`] is the composition root: it picks real or simulated adapters,
//! starts the refresh loop that samples sensors and feeds the live screen,
//! and keeps the app in the tray while a screen is live. What it composes
//! once the runtime is up is `setup`, which a test runs on Tauri's mock
//! runtime.
