//! What the studio does when the computer shuts down
//! (D-2026-10-03-power-off-standby-3): each screen gets the choice its user
//! made for it (`app::standby::at_shutdown` in the core), and nothing else
//! reaches any screen from then on.
//!
//! - Linux: [`watch_shutdowns`] holds a *delay* inhibitor lock of logind on
//!   the bus at the address the composition root gives (the system bus; a
//!   test's private one) for as long as the app runs. On
//!   `PrepareForShutdown(true)` it runs [`shut_down`] with logind's delay
//!   less [`MARGIN`] as the deadline, then closes the lock's descriptor, so
//!   the shutdown goes on; on `false` (cancelled) the final state ends, the
//!   lock is taken again and the live screen comes back as at the app's
//!   start. Without a bus or logind it says so ([`DiagCode`]) and each
//!   screen keeps its plan B.
//! - Windows: `RunEvent::Exit` while the session ends
//!   ([`bezel_power::session_ending`], `false` elsewhere) runs the same
//!   [`shut_down`], waiting for it, [`SESSION_END`] at most ([`at_exit`]);
//!   quitting the app applies nothing.
//!
//! [`shut_down`] first puts the session in its final state: no frame, no
//! reconnection, no link lent or opened, no storage operation
//! ([`Backend::enter_final_state`]). The running storage job is cancelled
//! and waited for; then the catalog is read again (a choice made by the CLI
//! while the studio runs counts) and each rev C screen whose choice is not
//! `keep` gets it: the live one through its open link, the other awake ones
//! opened for it; one asleep (its system off the bus) is left as it is,
//! never woken. The actions run on a thread of their own, so a screen that
//! hangs does not hold the shutdown past its deadline.
